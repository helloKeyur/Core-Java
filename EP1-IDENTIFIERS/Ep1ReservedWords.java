		#RESERVED WORDS
		-> In Java, Some words are reserved to represent some meaningfull functionality, such type of words are called Reserved words.
		-> In Java, return type is mandatory. if method don't return anything then we have to declare that method as void return type. but in c lang return type is optional, and default return type is int;
		-> all 53 Resereved word in java contains only lowercase alphabet symbols.
		-> In Java, we have only `new` keyword & there is no `delete` keywords. because destraction of useless objects is responsibility of garbeg collector.
		
		=> strictfp, enum, assert keywords are new in java.

		=> There are 53 Reserved Words.
			
			A). Keywords (50)
